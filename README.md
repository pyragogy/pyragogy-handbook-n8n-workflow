## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains the core **n8n automation workflow** that powers the AI-driven co-authoring process of the **Pyragogy Handbook**. It is a modular, scalable, and open-source system designed to orchestrate multiple AI agents—alongside human contributors—to collaboratively draft, refine, validate, and persist high-quality Markdown-based knowledge.

> As a cornerstone of [Pyragogy.org](https://pyragogy.org), this workflow exemplifies a new paradigm for AI-human co-creation in the context of peer learning.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The `pyragogy-handbook-n8n-workflow` transforms complexity into clarity by automating:

* Distributed writing tasks across AI agents
* Quality control and review cycles
* Semantic metadata management
* Multi-channel persistence and collaboration

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
  Coordinate specialized agents (e.g., Summarizer, Synthesizer, QA Agent) via a single automated workflow.

* **Automated Markdown Generation**
  Draft and refine handbook sections dynamically from human prompts or AI insights.

* **Cognitive Feedback Loops**
  Integrate human and AI feedback phases to ensure accuracy and depth.

* **Versioning & Storage**
  Syncs with GitHub (for version control) and PostgreSQL/Supabase (for structured storage and queryability).

* **Composable & Extensible**
  Built on n8n—easily adaptable to your own agents, triggers, and integrations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

* A running **n8n** instance (self-hosted or via cloud)
* API access to LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
* A **GitHub** repo for storing content
* A **PostgreSQL** database (Supabase optional)

---

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyragogy/pyragogy-handbook-n8n-workflow.git
cd pyragogy-handbook-n8n-workflow
```

1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance
   → Go to **Workflows > Import from File**
   → Choose `workflow.json` from this repo

2. Configure credentials for:

   * OpenAI or other LLM providers
   * GitHub (with write access token)
   * PostgreSQL/Supabase (connection string)

3. Adjust environment variables, repo names, and database config inside workflow nodes.

---

## 🛠️ Usage

Once configured, you can:

* Trigger the workflow manually or via webhook/scheduler
* Send a content idea or update
* Let agents generate, synthesize, validate, and persist the content
* Review/edit final output on GitHub
* Analyze metadata or query it from your PostgreSQL/Supabase backend
