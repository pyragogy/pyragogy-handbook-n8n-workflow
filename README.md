## üß† Overview

This repository contains the core **n8n automation workflow** that powers the AI-driven co-authoring process of the **Pyragogy Handbook**. It is a modular, scalable, and open-source system designed to orchestrate multiple AI agents‚Äîalongside human contributors‚Äîto collaboratively draft, refine, validate, and persist high-quality Markdown-based knowledge.

> As a cornerstone of [Pyragogy.org](https://pyragogy.org), this workflow exemplifies a new paradigm for AI-human co-creation in the context of peer learning.

---

## üéØ Purpose

The `pyragogy-handbook-n8n-workflow` transforms complexity into clarity by automating:

* Distributed writing tasks across AI agents
* Quality control and review cycles
* Semantic metadata management
* Multi-channel persistence and collaboration

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Agent Orchestration**  
  Coordinate specialized agents (e.g., Summarizer, Synthesizer, QA Agent) via a single automated workflow.

* **Automated Markdown Generation**  
  Draft and refine handbook sections dynamically from human prompts or AI insights.

* **Cognitive Feedback Loops**  
  Integrate human and AI feedback phases to ensure accuracy and depth.

* **Versioning & Storage**  
  Syncs with GitHub (for version control) and PostgreSQL/Supabase (for structured storage and queryability).

* **Composable & Extensible**  
  Built on n8n‚Äîeasily adaptable to your own agents, triggers, and integrations.

---

## üß¨ Architecture

The workflow leverages **n8n** as its orchestration layer, connecting various services and AI models.

```

### Agent Roles

* **Meta-Orchestrator**: Coordinates the entire workflow and manages task distribution
* **Summarizer**: Extracts key insights and creates concise summaries
* **Synthesizer**: Combines multiple sources into coherent content
* **Peer Reviewer**: Validates content quality and consistency
* **Sensemaking Agent**: Analyzes deeper patterns and connections
* **Prompt Engineer**: Optimizes interactions between agents

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A running **n8n** instance (self-hosted or cloud)
* API access to LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
* A **GitHub** repository for content storage
* A **PostgreSQL** database (Supabase recommended)
* Node.js 16+ (for local development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pyragogy/pyragogy-handbook-n8n-workflow.git
   cd pyragogy-handbook-n8n-workflow
   ```

2. **Import workflow into n8n**
   * Navigate to **Workflows > Import from File**
   * Select `workflow.json` from this repository
   * Activate the imported workflow

3. **Configure credentials**
   
   Set up the following credentials in your n8n instance:
   
   * **OpenAI/LLM Provider**: API key for language model access
   * **GitHub**: Personal access token with repository write permissions
   * **PostgreSQL/Supabase**: Database connection string
   * **SMTP**: Email configuration for approval notifications

4. **Environment Configuration**
   
   Update the following variables in workflow nodes:
   ```json
   {
     "GITHUB_REPO": "your-username/your-handbook-repo",
     "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname",
     "NOTIFICATION_EMAIL": "approver@your-domain.com"
   }
   ```

### Database Setup

Execute the following SQL to create required tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE handbook_content (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'draft',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_handbook_status ON handbook_content(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_handbook_metadata ON handbook_content USING GIN(metadata);
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Manual Trigger

1. Navigate to your n8n workflow
2. Click "Execute Workflow"
3. Provide input parameters:
   ```json
   {
     "topic": "AI Ethics in Education",
     "context": "Exploring ethical implications...",
     "priority": "high"
   }
   ```

### Webhook Trigger

Send a POST request to your workflow webhook:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/pyragogy-handbook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "topic": "Collaborative Learning Patterns",
    "context": "Analysis of peer-to-peer learning dynamics"
  }'
```

### Scheduled Execution

Configure a cron trigger in n8n to run the workflow periodically:
* Daily content updates: `0 9 * * *`
* Weekly reviews: `0 10 * * 1`

---

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

The workflow includes built-in monitoring capabilities:

* **Execution Metrics**: Track success rates and processing times
* **Content Quality Scores**: AI-generated quality assessments
* **Human Feedback**: Approval/rejection rates and comments
* **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and retry mechanisms

Access metrics through:
* n8n execution history
* PostgreSQL analytics queries
* Custom dashboard (coming soon)

---

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Agents

1. Create a new HTTP node in n8n
2. Configure the agent's specific prompt and parameters
3. Connect it to the workflow at the appropriate stage
4. Update the consensus check logic if needed

### Modifying Content Structure

Edit the content template in the Synthesizer node:

```javascript
const contentTemplate = {
  title: "{{ $json.title }}",
  sections: [
    { heading: "Overview", content: "{{ $json.overview }}" },
    { heading: "Key Concepts", content: "{{ $json.concepts }}" },
    { heading: "Applications", content: "{{ $json.applications }}" }
  ],
  metadata: {
    tags: "{{ $json.tags }}",
    difficulty: "{{ $json.difficulty }}",
    estimated_reading_time: "{{ $json.reading_time }}"
  }
};
```

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests

Run individual node tests:
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=nodes
```

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### Load Testing

Simulate concurrent requests:
```bash
npm run load-test -- --concurrent=10 --duration=60s
```

---

## üîê Security Considerations

* **API Keys**: Store all credentials securely in n8n's credential system
* **Webhook Security**: Use webhook authentication tokens
* **Database Access**: Implement role-based access control
* **Content Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs and AI outputs
* **Audit Logging**: Track all content modifications and approvals

---

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Recommended Settings

* **Workflow Timeout**: 300 seconds for complex content generation
* **Concurrent Executions**: Limit to 3 to prevent API rate limiting
* **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
* **Memory Usage**: Monitor for large content processing

### Scaling Guidelines

* **Horizontal Scaling**: Deploy multiple n8n instances with load balancing
* **Database Optimization**: Use connection pooling and read replicas
* **Caching**: Implement Redis for frequently accessed content
* **CDN Integration**: Serve static assets through CloudFront or similar
